# Part 2: modify an intercepted ElGamal ciphertext so it decrypts to a chosen

# Known stuff:
# The public shared base g = 42
# The public shared prime p = 29837
# Systemâ€™s public key PK = gx mod p = 22690
# You intercept one of these encrypted messages:
# c1 = 23447
# c2 = 8372

PK = 22690

c2 = 8372

my_student_number = 111111      # chosen random student number

# Reduce both values modulo p (safe habit)
orig = original_student_number % p
target = my_student_number % p

# Compute multiplier t = target * orig^{-1} (mod p)
# Then c2' = c2 * t (mod p) will decrypt to target
